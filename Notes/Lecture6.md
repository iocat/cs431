Software is mostly complex. 

### Claim
Software is easier than we thought. And hardware is a complex one.

Why software system is simpler, or easier, less complex than hardware:
(Can we really compare these two aspects, like apple and orage?)
1) > is discrete and precise, it lends itself into precise reasoning| it  should be more reliable than H
    Why? 
    Physical device is basically about continuity. Not very precise, but not stable. Software is very precise. 

2) The structure of the software system is not constrained by physical structures of space and sometimes time. 
(seems to be good, but can be bad without any constraint/well-established rules)
 
Design a system in software is far easier than designing a system in hardware

To reason about a machine level program, we must know every single instruction
The problem is: there is no rule about this!

3) The process of the construction and change is unconstraint3) The producer of the construction is unconstraint3) The producer of the construction is unconstraint

4) Software can be duplicable. Fantastic degree of mass production. It can work everywhere using the right tools?
