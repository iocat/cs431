Testing:
Divide the domain into regions of uniformity (the properties of the domains)
1. Pick out t between the regions and test the region

2 types of testing:
1. White box testing
1. Black box testing
1. Gray-box testing: something in between 

Use different strategies to apply the same test suites to figure out if the test suite is correct.

Say that you have 100% statement coverage, is it enough?
No. Say there is a condition we didn't implement/handle in the system, the test code could not check that. 

- Use cases
- Simulation

Build a simulation system of the bank
