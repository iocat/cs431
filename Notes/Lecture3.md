Dependibility: certain important properties that the system depends on to work.
    - A property is dependable when:
        - verifiable
        - stable: against evolution, and attacks.
    - Two kinds of properties: 
        - Component Properties. ( not dealt with in this course )
        - System Properties.
Comprehensibility: 
    Change that is understandable
Manageability:
Scalability
Security:
    - Host: of a single machine.
    - Communication: end to end safety.
    - System.

Group Project 1:
Parking Lot Project.
Refer to the lecture note.

Solution Discussed:
- 1 single system that knows about the system. Drawback: manager dies.
- gate: token distributor. You have a pool of limited C tokens divided equally among the gates. Question: Do they share the tokens.
    - Not share: then the car has to wait to get in. 
    - Peer-to-peer communicate to share tokens. 

    Peer to peer communication also needs a manager to detect all the related machine. 

Found the solutions:
    - Use token.
    - Distribution between gates
    - There's a manager sitting to govern
    - Should never rely on an outside factor or a centralized host. 

Traffic: two related role
    - Generate traffic
        - Based on certain probablity that simulates the intensity of traffic.
    - A global clock
