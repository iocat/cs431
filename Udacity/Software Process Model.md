# Software Process Model
1. Determine the order of the phases. 
1. Transition Criteria of the model.

### Waterfall
Not Flexible.
### Spiral 
Pros:
- Risk Reduction
- Functionality can be added in the later phases
- Software Produced Early.

Cons:
- Highly dependent on risk analysis
- Complex
- Specific Expertise
- Costly to Implement.

## Evolutionary Prototyping
Initial concept -> Design and Implement Initial Prototype -> Refine Prototype until acceptable (repeat many times) -> Complete and release prototype. 

The prototype (part of the system) is immediately produced and shown to the customer. Not all requirements are understood. 
Either the prototype is improved or extended.

Pros: 
- Immediate Feedback

Cons:
- Difficult to plan because we don't know how many iterations are needed to complete.

## Rational Unified Process (RUP)
Each iteration performs 4 phases. Do all of the phases in Software Process with different extents depending on which phase we are in.
1. Inception: Scope of the system. Limit the domain, perform initial cost estimate.
2. Elaboration: Refine basic architecture.
3. Construction: The development starts.
4. Transition: Development -> Deployment. 

## Agile:
Based on highly iterative and incremental development.
TDD iterates:
1. RED: Write test that fails and encode the requirements
1. GREEN: make only enough code to make the test cases pass. The structure of code deteriorates.
1. Refactor: Modify the code to make it more readable and maintainable, improve the design of the code.

# Choosing a model

Appropriate model -> Success. 
Factors: 
- Requirement understanding
- Expected lifetime
- Risk
- Schedule constraints
- Interaction with management
- Expertise
